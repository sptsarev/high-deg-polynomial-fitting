# tested for Julia v1.2
##### this version works with Float64 arithmetic
##### !!!! and only for data with a uniform time step (for the discrete argument)

# This script robustly approximates a (probably vector-valued) time series with polynomials of large degrees
# (up to a few hundred) in the sense of the best RMS (best least squares) approximation
# any one-dimensional set of scalar or vector-valued data (which formally can be considered a function of a discrete argument)
# with a very large number of points (thousands)
# and find the approximation residue.
# You can approximate the entire dataset by polynomials on the entire data (or a part thereof) available in the file,
# or alternatively using a sliding window (possibly with overlapping).

# Requires auxiliary script service_functions-en.jl with some service functions

# Script launch parameters:
############################################################

# julia.exe <script-name.jl> <file> <read_columns> <output_degrees> <windowsparams>
# where:

# <script-name.jl> - the name of this file
 
# <file> - name of the input file with the data being processed
# The file contains the data for approximation in columns - a plain text file with numeric data in any standard format: integer, floating point, exponential format.
# The file may contain empty and commented lines (the # character is used for commenting), such lines will be skipped in processing.
 
# <read_columns> - numbers of columns read from the file;
# numbers are indicated in square brackets,
# the first is the number of the column containing the discrete argument ("time"),
# if the line number should be used as a discrete argument,
# you have to specify 0 as the argument column (see examples);
# second and subsequent column numbers are columns that contain (vector)-function of the disctere argument.
# Examples of specifying column numbers:
# [1,2] - the first column of the file will be read as a discrete argument, the second - as a function of this argument;
# [0,1] - the line number will act as a discrete argument, the first column of the file as its function;
# [2,5:9] - the second column will act as a discrete argument, the  vector-function columns will be 5,6,7,8,9

# <output_degrees> - indicates degrees of approximating polynomials that will be used to output the results.
# Best least squares approximation is performed from degree 0 to the maximum degree specified in this parameter, but only the specified degrees will produce the output files.
# Examples of indicating the degrees:
# [1,2,3,4,5] - approximation by polynomials up to the 5th degree is performed, and the result is output after approximation by polynomials of degrees (1,2,3,4,5);
# [5] - approximation is carried out again by polynomials up to the 5th degree, but the result is output only for approximation by the best approximation polynomial of the 5th degree;
# [1:4, 5:5:20] - approximation by polynomials up to the 20th degree is performed, and the result is output for approximations by polynomials of degrees (1,2,3,4,5,10,15,20).
# The notations 1:4 and 5:5:20 have the same meaning as for loops in Julia.

# <windowsparams> - data processing windows parameters
# The script has the ability to process data in three ways:
# M:N - one window is given;
# M:W:N - windows with one point overlapping;
# M:W:S:N - with windows with a given overlap.
# Here:
# M - starting point of the first window,
# N - last point of the last window (as the last point
# you can specify the end of the file, the "end" keyword is used for this),
# W - window size
# S - windows overlap.
# !!! IMPORTANT NOTE - 1 !!!
# When forming windows, the last window is formed so that
# the last point of this window coincided with the last given point N,
# at the same time, the overlap with the penultimate window may be greater than specified in the parameter S.
# !!! IMPORTANT NOTE - 2 !!!
# If the specified window size is larger than the amount of data available, then the script exits logging the error in the log file.
# *************************************************** *********
# Examples of specifying window parameters:
# 1:end - one window is formed, the entire input file will be processed;
# 1:1000 - one window with a size of 1000 points is formed, the starting point;
# matches the first data point, the window end matches 1000th data point;
# 1:100:1000 - windows with the size of 100 points are formed at the following points (1, 100), (100, 199), (199, 298), ..., (901, 1000);
# 1:100:10:1000 - windows with a size of 100 points are formed with 10 points overlapping: (1, 100), (91, 190), (181, 280), ..., (901, 1000).

# SCRIPT RESULTS
####################################################### ###########

# As a result of the script, APPROX directory is formed in the starting directory,
# in which one subdirectory is created with the name <out_dir_name>,
# then in this subdirectory individually for each approximated column from <read_columns>,
# and each degree from <output_degrees> and each processing window,
# a file containing 4 columns is created. Its columns are:
# <discrete arguments>,
# <initial approximated values>,
# <values ​​of the approximating polynomial>,
# <approximation residue = difference between the second and third columns>.
# The name of each file containd the number of the approximated column, the approximation window (line number of the file,
# not including comments) and the degree of approximating polynomial.
# All results in the files are printed with @sprintf ("% 1.15e", ...) - you can change the number of printed digits if necessary.

# *************************************************** *********
# Additionally, a file is created in the APPROX directory (appending new lines if the file exists) result_max_resid.txt,
# which contains the maximum(abs(residues)) at the maximal degree approximation for each window for each of the input columns,
# and the following data is written as one new line:
# - <out_dir_name> name of the output approximation directory;
# - <current_window> window being processed;
# - maximum(abs(residues)) for each approximated column in the current window with the maximal degree of approximation.

# *************************************************** *********
# To keep the errors, the errorlog_approx.log file is created in the script launch directory,
# which displays the following types of errors with the name of the experiment and the start time:
# "Incorrect data, 0 lines read" - occurs if the script could not
# read the source file or invalid column numbers were specified;
# "Invalid data, window length greater than data size" -
# informs that when setting windows parameters the window size was incorrectly selected
# and there is not enough data to cover at least 1 window.

####################################################### ###########
# Launch example:
####################################################### ###########
# julia <script.jl> F-testdata.txt [1:4] [0,1,3,5:5:20] 1:end
# 5:5:20 in <output_degrees> means a list of degrees with start 5, step 5 and end 20
# 1:end means processing the entire "time" interval, from the beginning of the file to the end as a single window.
